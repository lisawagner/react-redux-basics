# react-redux-basics
This is a React study project. Created so far:
  1. Simple Todo List component where the user can add and delete list items
  2. HOC experiments - created different methods for using hooks on class based components via hocs

      Since withRouter is depricated in React Router 6, alternatives are needed for instances where it isn't feasible to upgrade all your class components to functional components. If you are interested in more info on how to do this, check out these links:
